# Anthro Cartoon Horse

A pattern for a cute cartoony Horse, anthro style.

This should result in a 35cm tall plushie when printed as A4 size. 
It is entirely compatible with doll joints in legs and arms for flexibility altho I recommend fixing the legs in place and having only the arms movable.

Lines and what they mean:
- Cut along solid lines
- Sew along dotted lines
- Dashed lines are for alignment of parts
- the wide dotted line indicates you will have to sew by hand, do this last
